# Introduction

The Python standard library has a wealth of useful features. This section will focus on examples that have come up most often in projects over the years.

# Execution

All standard library examples are exercised by way of unit tests using PyTest. Running PyTest from the directory will run all standard library example tests. These tests serve as documentation on usage if you would like to use the elements of the standard library in your projects.
