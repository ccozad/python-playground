# Introduction

There are a variety of ways to use Python to serve content over the web. Some approaches keep one close to the data and rely on the developer to manipulate HTTP requests and responses directly. Other approaches provide a large library of high level abstractions to accomplish common tasks. This section of the references is divided by the style of framework used.
