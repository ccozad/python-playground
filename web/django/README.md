# Introduction
Django uses a code first approach to specify database table and relationships. The ORM then maps those models to database structures for a variety of technologies. The model system also opens up a strong library of query and update routines which can be supplemented for raw SQL for advanced usages. A built in admin panel makes it easy to work with database content.
