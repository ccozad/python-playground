# Introduction

The section explores various algorithms. Many of these classic algorithms exist in various standard libraries and popular third party libraries. The reader is encouraged to understand these data structures in terms of the style of problem solving and thinking involved. Ideas explored in data structures may lend to original solutions for niche applications.

# Execution

All algorithms are exercised by way of unit tests using PyTest. Running PyTest from the directory will run all algorithm tests. These tests serve as documentation on usage if you would like to use an algorithm in your projects.

# Algorithms

## [Binary Search](/algorithms/binary_search_client.py)

Binary search is a divide and conquer search algorithm that splits the search space in half with each pass. It has a worst case performance of O(log n). Binary Search relies on the data being pre-sorted to take advantage of the ording to decide which half of the search space to eliminate. See the Wikipedia article on Binary Search for more details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm
